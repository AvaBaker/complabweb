## Policies  

### Attendance  
Attendance is crucial. If sick, notify the instructor and stay home. Excused absences allow for makeup evaluations.

### Collaboration  
Work together, but submit your own answers. Collaboration on quizzes, midterms, and finals is prohibited.  
Dishonesty, plagiarism, and violations of the Lehigh University Honor Code will be reported.

## Technology  

### Computing  
Python 3 will be used to illustrate statistical concepts. However, coding is **not required** for assignments in this course. Coding will be reserved for **BSTA103 â€“ Algorithms Lab II**.

## Assignments  

### Grading Breakdown  

| Item         | Weight  |
|--------------|---------|
| Quizzes      | 25%     |
| Homework     | 50%     |
| Midterm      | 12.5%   |
| Final        | 12.5%   |

### Homework  
Homework is due in person, one week after the assignment is given. Late homework grades are reduced as follows:  
\[
f(\text{grade}, \text{days late}) = \text{grade} \times e^{-0.35 \cdot \text{days late}}
\]  
Homework more than one week late is evaluated as zero unless related to documented mental or physical illness.

### Exams  
- **Midterm:** In-class, full period.  
- **Final:** In-class, full period.  
- **Quizzes:** Due by midnight on the same day they are assigned. No communication with anyone except the instructor is allowed for quizzes and exams.  

### Extra Credit  
Extra credit opportunities arise through activities like attending out-of-class lectures, pointing out mistakes in course material, or suggesting relevant datasets or articles.

## Grading  
Grading focuses on technical correctness and clear reasoning. Brief, clear answers that explain your thinking are valued over just correct numerical answers.

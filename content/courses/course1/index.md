## Abstract
This course aims to introduce students to models that describe the spread of a pathogen through a population, and how models can support public health decisions. Students will be expected to complete mathematical/statistical exercises and write code that simulates infectious processes.

## Course materials
The notes/text are free for use and available at [Book](https://computationaluncertaintylab.github.io/outbreak_book/intro.html). 
Students should note that the "book" may be updated periodically throughout the semester.

## Additional Graduate Student Requirements

Graduate students must pose and answer their own question for each homework assignment.  
These questions may be used in future iterations of the course.  
Graduate students are not eligible for extra credit.

## Textbook  

The course will follow notes available at: [Outbreak Book](https://computationaluncertaintylab.github.io/outbreak_book/intro.html).  
Additional resources include:  
1. *An Introduction to Infectious Disease Modeling* by Emilia Vynnycky and Richard White  
2. *Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals* by Keeling and Rohani  

Students should understand introductory probability, statistics, and the algebra of random variables. A free reference is available [here](https://github.com/tomcm39/2022S-BSTA001-Textbook/blob/main/phds.pdf).

## Policies  

### Attendance  
Attendance is crucial. If sick, let the instructor know and stay home. Excused absences allow for makeup evaluations.

### Collaboration  
Work together, but submit your own answers. Collaboration on quizzes, midterms, and finals is not allowed.

### Frustration  
If frustrated, take a break, return later, and ask for help if needed.

---

## Technology  

### Computing  
We will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for simulations and statistical training. 
VSCode is recommended as an IDE.
Students will use DataCamp for Python programming training.

## Assignments  

### Grading Breakdown  

| Item         | Weight  |
|--------------|---------|
| Quizzes      | 25%     |
| Homework     | 50%     |
| Midterm      | 12.5%   |
| Final        | 12.5%   |

### Homework  
Homework is due in person, one week after assignment. Late homework grades are reduced as follows:  
$
f(\text{grade}, \text{days late}) = \text{grade} \times e^{-0.35 \cdot \text{days late}}
$  
No submissions via course site. Late assignments beyond a week receive zero.  

### Exams  
Midterms and finals are in-person oral exams. Quizzes are due by midnight on class days and test class engagement.  

### Datacamp  
Datacamp assignments will accompany homeworks.  

### Extra Credit  
Extra credit involves attending seminars and writing reflections, contributing as an additional quiz score.

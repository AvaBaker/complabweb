## Policies  

### Attendance  
Attendance is crucial. If sick, notify the instructor and stay home. Excused absences allow for makeup evaluations.

### Collaboration

## Assignments  

### Grading Breakdown  

| Item         | Weight  |
|--------------|---------|
| Quizzes      | 25%     |
| Homework     | 50%     |
| Midterm      | 12.5%   |
| Final        | 12.5%   |

### Homework  
Homework is due in person, one week after the assignment is given. Late homework grades are reduced as follows:  
\[
f(\text{grade}, \text{days late}) = \text{grade} \times e^{-0.35 \cdot \text{days late}}
\]  
Homework more than one week late is evaluated as zero unless related to documented mental or physical illness.

### Exams  
- **Midterm:** In-class, full period.  
- **Final:** In-class, full period.  
- **Quizzes:** Due by midnight on the same day they are assigned. No communication with anyone except the instructor is allowed for quizzes and exams.  

### Extra Credit

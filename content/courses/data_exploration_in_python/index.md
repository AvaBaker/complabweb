## Abstract
This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of programming in Python. Students will gain experience designing, implementing, and testing their Python code, as well as in using Jupyter Notebooks, and IPython for statistics and data analysis. Multiple programming paradigms will be explored. The course covers Python data types, input, and output, and control flow in the context of preparing, cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data. In addition, students will use Python to conduct exploratory data analyses, including computing descriptive statistics
This course aims to introduce students to models that describe the spread of a pathogen through a population, and how models can support public health decisions. Students will be expected to complete mathematical/statistical exercises and write code that simulates infectious processes.

## Textbook  

The course will follow several differnet books that are all available to Lehigh University students **free of charge**.
The textbooks/materials are above in the Tentative timeline.
The materials can be accessed for free via Lehigh Unviersity Library.

---

## Policies  

### Attendance  
Attendance is crucial. If sick, let the instructor know and stay home. Excused absences allow for makeup evaluations.

### Collaboration  
Work together, but submit your own answers. Collaboration on quizzes, midterms, and finals is not allowed.

### Frustration  
If frustrated, take a break, return later, and ask for help if needed.

---

## Technology  

### Computing  
We will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for simulations and statistical training. 
VSCode is recommended as an IDE.
Students will use DataCamp for Python programming training.

## Assignments  

### Grading Breakdown  

| Item         | Weight  |
|--------------|---------|
| Quizzes      | 25%     |
| Homework     | 50%     |
| Midterm      | 12.5%   |
| Final        | 12.5%   |

### Homework  
Homework is due in person, one week after assignment. Late homework grades are reduced as follows:  
$
f(\text{grade}, \text{days late}) = \text{grade} \times e^{-0.35 \cdot \text{days late}}
$  
No submissions via course site. Late assignments beyond a week receive zero.  

### Exams  
Midterms and finals are in-person oral exams. Quizzes are due by midnight on class days and test class engagement.  

### Datacamp  
Datacamp assignments may accompany homeworks.  

### Extra Credit  
Extra credit involves attending seminars and writing reflections, contributing as an additional quiz score.

# Data Exploration in Python

## Abstract
This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of programming in Python. Students will gain experience designing, implementing, and testing their Python code, as well as in using Jupyter Notebooks, and IPython for statistics and data analysis. Multiple programming paradigms will be explored. The course covers Python data types, input, and output, and control flow in the context of preparing, cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data. In addition, students will use Python to conduct exploratory data analyses, including computing descriptive statistics.

## Textbook  
The course does not require a textbook.
However, there are many texts that can be suggested such as
- [Introduction to Mathematical Statistics](https://minerva.it.manchester.ac.uk/~saralees/statbook2.pdf) by Hogg, McKean, Craig, 8th Edition.
- [Introduction to Probabiltiy Models](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/introduction-to-probability-model-s.ross-math-cs.blog_.ir_.pdf) by Sheldon Ross 10th Edition.
- [an-introduction-to-probability-theory-and-its-applications](https://bitcoinwords.github.io/assets/papers/an-introduction-to-probability-theory-and-its-applications.pdf) by William Feller 
The course may use different books that are all available to Lehigh University students *free of charge*.
The materials can be accessed for free via Lehigh Unviersity Library.
The textbooks/materials are above in the Tentative timeline.

## Policies  

### Attendance  
Attendance is crucial. If sick, let the instructor know and stay home. An excused absence allows for makeup evaluations.

### Collaboration  
Work together, but submit your own answers. Collaboration on quizzes, midterms, and finals is not allowed.

### Frustration  
If frustrated, take a break, return later, and ask for help if needed.

---

## Technology  

### Computing  
We will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for simulations and statistical training. 
There are several options for an integreated development environment to support Python programming.
Popular choices are:
1. VSCode [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. sPYder [Link](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
3. Jupyter Notebook [Link](https://jupyter.org/) <- Recommended for this course.

**Jupyter Cloud provided by Lehigh:**
Lehigh University provides a Jupyter Cloud, an easy to use platform for programmign in Python here ([Link](https://jupyter.cc.lehigh.edu/)
). **Note** to use Lehigh's Jupyter platform while not on campus Wi-Fi, you will need to logon to the University VPN.
Instructions for the VPN are here = [Link](https://lehigh.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LKB/pages/26677699/Windows+Mac+Linux+Download+and+Configure+the+VPN+client+Cisco+Secure+Client+prev.+AnyConnect)


**DataCamp:** Most, if not all, weeks of this course will ask students to use DataCamp for Python programming training.
DataCamp is provided by the University free of charge.

## Assignments  

### Grading Breakdown  

| Item          | Weight  |
|---------------|---------|
| Quizzes       | 12.5%   |
| Homework      | 65.0%   |
| Exam          | 10.0%   |
| Final Project | 12.5%   |

### Homework  
Homework is due in person, one week after assignment. Late homework grades are reduced as follows:
\begin{align*}
f(\text{grade}, \text{days late}) = \text{grade} \times e^{-0.35 \cdot \text{days late}}
\end{align*}
Late assignments beyond three days receive zero.  

### Exams
The Exam is an in-class exam on content up until that time.
The Final is a take home project that asks students to build a fully functional web-application in python that will draw on all aspects of the course.
Quizzes are due by midnight on class days. Quizes are quick and meant to test class engagement.  

### Datacamp  
Datacamp assignments may accompany homeworks.  

### Extra Credit
Extra credit involves attending seminars and writing reflections, contributing as an additional quiz score.
These opportunities will be mentioned during the course.

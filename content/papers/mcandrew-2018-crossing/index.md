Crossing survival curves complicate how we interpret results from a clinical trial's primary endpoint. We find the function to determine a crossing point's location depends exponentially on individual survival curves. This exponential relationship between survival curves and the crossing point transforms small survival curve errors into large crossing point errors. In most cases, crossing points are sensitive to individual survival errors and may make accurately locating a crossing point unsuccessful. We argue more complicated analyses for mitigating crossing points should be reserved only after first exploring a crossing point's variability, or hypothesis tests account for crossing point variability.
